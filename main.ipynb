This tool moves an item from its current location to a target location. It first finds the location of the item and the target using the \\'search_object\\' tool. Then it moves the robot to the location of the item using the \\'move_to_object\\' tool, grabs the item using the \\'grab_object\\' tool, moves the robot to the location of the target using the \\'move_to_object\\' tool again, and finally releases the item at the location of the target using the \\'release_object\\' tool. Parameters: [{\"name\": \"item_name\", \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the item to be moved.\", \"required\": true}, {\"name\": \"target_name\", \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the target object.\", \"required\": true}] Format the arguments as a JSON object.\\n\\n')\n"
