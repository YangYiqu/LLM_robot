Then it moves the robot to the location of the item using the 'move_to_object' tool, grabs the item using the 'grab_object' tool, moves the robot to the location of the target using the 'move_to_object' tool again, and finally releases the item at the location of the target using the 'release_object' tool. Parameters: [{"name": "item_name", "type": "string", "description": "The name of the item to be moved.", "required": true}, {"name": "target_name", "type": "string", "description": "The name of the target object.", "required": true}] Format the arguments as a JSON object.
